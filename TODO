Known bugs

Fixed bugs
----------
- Crash on appearance of Purchase Shares Sheet after Allocate Merging Hotel Shares Sheet pops up (seemingly randomly; see comment in AQGame (Private)'s _mergerHappeningAtTile: selector implementation). (FIXED 2008-Aug-07: I don't understand 100% why, but it seems to have gone without leakage.)
- Program crashes on certain instances of allocating merging hotel shares (happens when clicking sold shares stepper). (Potentially happens when merging hotels of different sizes.) (FIXED 2008-Aug-07: problem disappeared with decision to make the allocating merging hotel shares sheet application-modal.)
- Canceling the Create New Hotel sheet seems to make the game think a tile has been played, even though it was canceled. (FIXED 2008-Aug-07: reorganized selectors called in showing sheet)
- If Create New Hotel sheet is cancelled, it won't come back. (FIXED 2008-Aug-04: was trying to print instances of AQHotel instead of asking for the hotel's name, resulting in an attempted copyWithZone, which is intentionally not implemented for AQHotel)
- Game log scrolls to one line above bottom. (FIXED 2008-Jul-24: got text view to scroll itself instead of using its scroll view)
- Joining a game doesn't work. (FIXED 2008-Jul-13; was caused by not retrieving a UI widget's tag from the correct UI widget)
- Sometimes Netacquire doesn't send any handshake directives despite the connection being successful; should fail on such an occasion. (FIXED 2008-Jul-09; was caused by Netacquire not removing the player's display name fast enough, yet picking an odd way to send an error about the issue)
