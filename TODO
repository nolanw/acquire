New features
------------

- Store ~5 last connected servers and ports (instead of one) for the Welcome Window.

- Color rack tiles with the hotels they'd be a part of, or a different color if they merge, or whatever.

- Redo game list drawer.
	- Make it look nicer!
	- Differentiate games that can be joined as player, as observer, or not at all.
