New features
------------
- Allow for both new and old hotel names (user-configurable?).
	- Switch hotel colors too.
- Make scoreboard columns' backgrounds relate to their hotels.
- Provide a legend of hotels and their colors.
- Design and implement a proper game logging class (which the Game Log in the Game Window class can access).
- Clean up menus.
	- Make separate local game and network game menus.
	- Make useful menu options.
- Store ~5 last connected servers and ports (instead of one) for the Welcome Window.
- Local games with two players: implement board's hand in hotel mergers.
- Color rack tiles with the hotels they'd be a part of, or a different color if they merge, or whatever.
- Similar to previous item: note tiles that cannot currently be played (would create new hotel but no hotels off the board), and don't highlight them.
- Change the Purchase Shares Sheet's submit button to say something else when it's possible to end the game.
- Redo game list drawer.
	- Make it look nicer!
	- Differentiate games that can be joined as player, as observer, or not at all.
	- Update on new game creation (instead of timed events).
	- Make 'Create Game' button a permanent fixture on the top.
- Generate appcast.xml and appropriate release notes page when building a Release.
- Show value of shares being sold during merger.
- Show unplayable tiles on the board.


Desired rearrangements
----------------------
- Instead of sheets calling different methods depending on local/network game, ensure they call the same method, which itself does what's needed.
- Divide classes into common, LocalGame and NetworkGame sections.
- Eliminate need for passthru selectors where reasonable.

- Classes I've rearranged:
	- AQBoard, AQGame, AQHotel, AQPlayer, AQTile, AQNetacquireDirective, AQConnectionController

Known bugs
---------
- Network game: sending messages involving quotation marks often crashes Netacquire.
- Network game: Netacquire sometimes appends directives to game chat messages, making the chunk of directives unparseable. Rather than crash, those directives show up in the message view.
