New features
------------
- Implement network play.
	- Let user create a new game.
- Allow for both new and old hotel names (user-configurable?).
- Make scoreboard columns' backgrounds relate to their hotels.
- Provide a legend of hotels and their colors.
- Design and implement a proper game logging class (which the Game Log in the Game Window class can access).
- Make separate local game and network game menus.
- Implement the board's winning of some shares in two-player local games.
- Store ~5 last connected servers and ports (instead of one) for the Welcome Window.
- Local games with two players: implement board's hand in hotel mergers.
- Color rack tiles with the hotels they'd be a part of, or a different color if they merge, or whatever.
- Similar to previous item: note tiles that cannot currently be played (would create new hotel but no hotels off the board), and don't highlight them.
- Change the Purchase Shares Sheet's submit button to say something else when it's possible to end the game.
- Redo game list drawer.
	- Make it look nicer!
	- Differentiate games that can be joined as player, as observer, or not at all.
	- Update on new game creation (instead of timed events).
	- Make 'Create Game' button a permanent fixture on the top.
- Generate appcast.xml and appropriate release notes page when building a Release.


Desired rearrangements
----------------------
- Instead of sheets calling different methods depending on local/network game, ensure they call the same method, which itself does what's needed.
- Divide classes into common, LocalGame and NetworkGame sections.


Known bugs
---------
- Network game: Merger Survivor sheet and Create Hotel sheet don't switch between Phoenix and Quantum.
- Network game: Sometimes able to buy five shares.
- Network game: Just-merged hotel still shows up on the purchase sheet.
- Network game: Trying to trade in four shares results in only one share being obtained.
- Network game: need to check for unplayable tiles and disable/discard them. (Unsure how to discard them and get new ones... go Netacquire.)

Fixed
-----
- Can't disconnect from a server that has crashed.
- "Active player" is indicated at odd times (e.g. after the game is over and before the game begins).
- Network error sometimes comes up immediately or shortly after a display name in use error.
- Can't send lobby messages.
- Local games aren't quit properly.
- Scoreboard columns aren't big enough for two digits.
- Game log entries don't go to the game log.
- Network game: Phoenix and Quantum are the same colour (purple).

New
---
- Player now alerted when it's his turn.
